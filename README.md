# Astraloq

A service for astronomy enjoyers to come together and share pictures about their passion.

# How Its Made
_React, Typescript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Chakra-UI, VSCode_

To build Astraloq, we used React on the frontend, FastAPI on the backend, and NeonDB (serverless PostgreSQL) as our database. We used Chakra-UI for styled React components and SQLModel as an ORM to synchronize our Python data models with our database schema. On the development side, we used VSCode as our editor of choice and DBeaver as our database client. For some of our astronomy-related event data and photos, we pulled resources from an AstronomyAPI.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
All in all, we're super proud of all that we were able to accomplish in just 24 hours with relatively new tech stack. We're also proud of how much we learned in a single weekend.

Some key features we're particularly proud of include:
- Event-based live chat and photo sharing
- User profiles
- Global and local events calendar
